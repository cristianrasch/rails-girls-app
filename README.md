Welcome Rails Girls
===================

Intro
-----
This is basically the implementation of the [Rails Girls tutorial](http://guides.railsgirls.com/app/) but with a slight twist towards making sure you start off on the right foot by fully testing your first app. Will be fun, promise!

A little challenge
------------------
If you navigate to the [idea_test.rb](https://github.com/cristianrasch/rails-girls-app/blob/master/test/unit/idea_test.rb) file you will notice there is a pending test, right at the bottom of the file. Well, the challenge for you is to delete that pending statement and implement the absolutely minimum amount of code to make the unit test pass. You can check whether your unit tests pass or not by running the rake test:units task on the console.

That's it short and sweet as they say, happy coding!!
